# The Fam

I was born in Arkansas but my family moved to Missouri when I was young. I have four sisters, two who also go to Mizzou, one who lives in Australia, and one who lives in Texas. My dad is from California and my mom is from Indonesia. My parents met on UseNet, which gives you a good idea of what they're like.

My oldest sister is currently developing a tabletop RPG called [Breakaway](http://www.breakaway.pub/). Since I'm awesome I'm going to plug it here for her.
