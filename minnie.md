# The Best Cat in the World

This is Minnie. To be honest, she is not technically my cat. She's my boyfriend's cat. However, I love her and she loves me and that's what matters.

She enjoys plastic balls with bells inside them, cuddling in the morning, and wet cat food. Her full name is Minerva. We adopted her from the Humane Society for free because they had recovered 40-something cats from a hoarder house, including her. She is extremely well-behaved and nice except for car rides, which turn her into a demon from hell.
